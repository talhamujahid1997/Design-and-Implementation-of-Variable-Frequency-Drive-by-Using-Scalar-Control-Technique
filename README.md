An IEEE article: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9048192
Abstractâ€”This paper deals with the variable frequency drive in which the speed of single phase induction motor (SPIM) control by using scalar control technique. Single-phase induction engines are utilized in low control applications and broadly utilized in household applications as well as in mechanical applications. These motors are very cheap and their construction as well as maintenance is simple. Its rating varies from fractional horse power up to thousands horse power. The designed variable frequency drive will control the speed of single phase induction motor as per requirement of the user. Moreover, this drive is interfaced with laptop and operated by the software called Arduino-IDE through which frequency controlled signals are given to inverter and the exploratory tests of this SPIM drive is depicted.
